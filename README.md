The four projects and the kaggle competition of the course Neural Networks of the Bachelor in Data Science and Engineering, all of them are developed in python with PyTorch. The projects are:

- Denoising autoencoder for MNIST and FMNIST images.
- Calibration of neural networks.
- Sentiment analysis with LSTMs.
- Variational autoencoder to generate images from the CelebA dataset.
- Kaggle competition: classification of signals.
